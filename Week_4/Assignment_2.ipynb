    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the practice of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. The internal details of the class are hidden from the outside world, and access to the data is controlled through methods. This enhances data security and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential characteristics. It allows you to create a simplified representation of an object that hides the unnecessary details. Abstraction helps manage complexity and focus on the relevant features of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Inheritance enables a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (base class or parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, where the subclass inherits characteristics from the parent class and can also have additional features of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows you to define methods in a generic way in the superclass, and then specific implementations in the subclasses. This enables flexibility and extensibility in code, as different objects can respond differently to the same method call."

It stands for \"initialize\" and is often referred to as the constructor method. This method is automatically called when a new object of a class is instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the __init__() function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attribute Initialization: The primary purpose of __init__() is to initialize the attributes (data members) of an object. When you create a new object, you often want to set initial values for its attributes. This method allows you to pass values to the object's attributes when it's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instance-specific Initialization: Since each object of a class can have different attribute values, __init__() allows you to provide unique initial values for each object. This way, objects can have distinct states when they start.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation: By setting attribute values within the __init__() method, you can ensure that the object starts in a consistent and well-defined state. This supports the principle of encapsulation, as you control the initial setup of the object's internal data."

    "\n",
